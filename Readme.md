Description of the Project:

This file contains the code for the lego car we have built as part of the Introduction to Engineering (FSE100) course. We had to design, 
assemble and code a car that goes through a maze with colors on the floor, walls and go from one station (color = station) to another, 
pick up a card board created grandma, drop her off safely at a different location and go back to its initial station. The car had sensors 
as gyro, touch sensor, color detector, and two motors. The EV3 kit library was integrated into MATLAB and the code for the car was written on MATLAB.
