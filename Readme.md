This repository contains the implementation of a **Lego Car Maze Navigation System**, a project designed to autonomously navigate a maze using programmed algorithms and hardware integration. The system employs sensors, motors, and intelligent algorithms to ensure precise and efficient movement within the maze.

## üöÄ Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: The Lego car can navigate through a maze without manual intervention unless entered remote control function.
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes ultrasonic, infrared, or other sensors to detect walls, paths, and obstacles.
- **Dynamic Decision-Making**: Implements algorithms for:
  - Pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.
  - Real-time adjustments to navigate the maze effectively.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy-to-read and modify code for experimentation and enhancements.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Python/Arduino**: For programming and control logic.
- **Lego Mindstorms EV3/NXT**: Hardware platform for building the car.
- **Ultrasonic and Infrared Sensors**: For obstacle detection and distance measurement.
- **Motor Drivers**: For controlling the car's movement.
